Kept security access control for treatment exemption in L5 phase 2 and for treatment suspension in phase 3 as confirmed with Monica, Ameya, Antonio and Amita. 5 march 2025 Malak v4.6 version 21 was published to mobily with above changes (20 Feb till 4 Mar). 10 March  2025 Malak v 4.7 added below statements as aligned with our project and product teams. If customer is in Collections Grace Period, and the exempt from treatment flag is enabled while in collections grace, then collections grace will be automatically cancelled, and the customer will be able to use all his available credit limit. (this is part of L5 phase 2) If customer has an active Payment arrangement, and then the exempt from treatment flag is enabled, the payment arrangement will be automatically cancelled, and the remaining installments will be added to the due amount and included in the invoice. (payment arrangement is for L5 phase 3) 12 March Malak v4.8 step 13: as aligned with design and delivery team (Vaibhav and Monica), this rule is moved from treatment use case to this use case: Customer cannot request P2P/Grace while its in Voluntary Suspension state and went in treatment.

(Removed below as requested in E2E walkthrough session since the steps are general and not specific to Mobily.) If the customer fails to make the payment on the payment due date: • An SMS (if configured) will be triggered to the customer’s contact number as and when a customer enters the collection treatment or moves from one collection step to another or exits the collection treatment. • An email (if configured) will be sent to the customer’s email address as and when a customer enters the collection treatment or moves from one collection step to another or exits the collection treatment. • A letter will be sent to the customer’s postal address requesting overdue payment. • Penalty fees will be charged if there is no response from the customer. • The customer’s account will be suspended . • A write-off happens, and the query is closed note: Customer shall also be able to make early or advance payments of unbilled amount if he/she doesn't have any pending bills. This is supported in another view on CC. (no use case in L4.2 for this) note: Bulk actions on a list of customers (e.g. suspend multiple customers) is requested and is to be discussed during design how and where to implement it. this might.  this might be subject to CCB. (This is not part of this use case. it is covered in below use case or as part of another use case that will be created for ongoing CCB discussion (CR-BUS-079) - L5-L4.2-GetReady-16 Consolidated Managing Workgroup Allocation for Collections and WBA REQ_2182 The solution shall support treatment entry based on specific business parameters e.g., Customer segment, overdue time , overdue amount etc. 2 As per pre-condition - Customer has called the Call Center and agent is on the Customer Dashboard. Customer 360 displayed to the agent. 3 4 Agent views the customer collection details. Agent navigates to the collections tab. COLL002 Solution shall require Customer Connect to display the correct Bar status for customers who are in collections. COLL007 Solution shall allow collection agents to view the bills, payments, credit control history, and the follow up history under the customer information. Subject to CCB Output of CCB - All fields are available but in different screens , cannot present in single screen (Requirement to present in single collection tab is dropped by Mobily) 5 Customer in treatment Collection summary, status, and the amount due are displayed. REQ_2199 The solution shall allow the customer's financial account to be traversed through various treatment steps once he enters the treatment process. 6 Customer is exempt from treatment. For customers with an exemption, an Exempted status will be displayed. Exemption from treatment rules as confirmed with Mobily (4 March 2025): The use case to Add or remove customer to/from whitelist in CC is not in the planned scope for L5. However, we can exempt customers from collections using the “Exempt from Treatment” flag. As part of this use case, Whitelist flag will not be used in the logic for any treatment exemption. Exempt from Treatment flag will be instead used as explained below and customer will not enter treatment at all if this flag is enabled. Exempt from treatment flag can be updated from CC or via patch customer API. If it is enabled, it will exempt the customer from entering collections until it is disabled. If it is disabled, the customer may enter collections, and treatment steps will start from the date of unchecking the flag not from the oldest invoice generation date. If the customer was in the treatment (any step, even DCA) and this flag is enabled later for him, he will be out of treatment, and this will result in unsuspending the service if it was suspended due to treatment. Only if this flag is enabled, customer will show as exempted from treatment in collections tab. For other reasons like Royal customer segment or below Treatment entry threshold, customers will not enter treatment but will not be marked as exempted from treatment in collections tab. There shall be specific security access control to allow only privileged profiles to enable/disable "exempt from treatment" flag. (Currently, this flag can be updated by anyone who has edit access to billing settings tab. it shall have separate access control ) If customer is in Collections Grace Period, and the exempt from treatment flag is enabled while in collections grace, then collections grace will be automatically cancelled, and the customer will be able to use all his available credit limit. AREQ_2188 "The solution shall ensure certain customers can be exempted from the treatment process. For example: • Customers on whitelist • Royal customers • Customers with balance outstanding 20 SAR for Individual, 100 SAR for RAQI & VIPs, 1 for FTTH. (These are configurable values)" => moved this part to the treatment use case for Raqi and FTTH since it is related to backend treatment rules => REQ_2188 will be achieved as explained in the previous column 7 Customer who is out of collections For Customer who is out of collection, Collection Overview tab will be displayed with all detail related to Collection Summary, Status, Amount Due and Collections history. Clarification: this is the case of customers who were in collections and paid their dues and are now out of collections. 8 Customer no debt episode For Customer who is no debt episode, Collection Overview tab will be displayed with all detail related to Collection Summary, Status, Amount Due and Collections history. Clarification: this is the case of customers whose bills are not yet generated, or dues are below treatment entry threshold. 9 Details displayed Collection Summary Shows status of customer when in collection.

REQ_2228 "The solution shall allow the service to be resumed when ""Promise To Pay"" is agreed if the service is in Bar status (OG/FB).

Additional effort will be required to ensure the service resumes once P2P is agreed if in Bar status." 14 To make payment arrangements in case of out of collection/No Debt Episode PAYMENT ARRANGEMENT IS DEFERRED TO L5 PHASE 3 Customer can take Payment arrangement any time after issue of invoice, even after full bar, till termination. cd 85 When Customer created a Payment Arrangement at that time customer is in Out of Collection then after Bill Due date breached customer will enter collection. But Collection activity will be on hold till payment arrangement is active. Note: If customer didn't pay the installment amount on time, payment arrangement is immediately broken, and the remaining installment amount should be added to the next bill. Aligned with Mobily IT: When a promise to pay is broken, customer goes back to the treatment step that he was in before the payment arrangement, and then progresses from there in the treatment steps as per the treatment plan. There are no notifications or reminders before each payment due date in the P2P plan. (this is the confirmed product behavior) Customer should progress into collection if his current invoice is overdue. the payment arrangement is cancelled once customer enters full bar due to treatment. breaking Payment arrangement will not affect the treatment path since customer will already be in collections. Invoice: Payment arrangement needs to be in the invoice: e.g. weekly, weekly amount, total number of installments, how many installments left.

REQ_2229 The solution shall allow the customer to exit from treatment immediately if the promise is kept (i.e., Payment is done resulting in his account balance less than the minimum treatment value) REQ_4058 Solution shall allow the customer to take Payment arrangement (promise to pay) any time after issue of invoice, even after full bar, till termination. cd 85 REQ_4064 If customer didn't pay the payment arrangement installment amount on time, payment arrangement is immediately broken, and the remaining amount is added to the next bill. treatment steps resume. REQ_4065 Even if customer has an active payment arrangement and is paying on time, solution will still progress him into collection if his current invoice is overdue. the payment arrangement is cancelled once customer enters full bar due to treatment.

PAYMENT ARRANGEMENT IS DEFERRED TO L5 PHASE 3 After clicking the cancel button, a pop up will appear to confirm the cancellation. Click on Confirm. After clicking the existing plan will be cancelled. After canceling payment, the arrangement rack will be hidden and only view button will be visible to check the details of cancelled arrangement. On the collection summary page, the Payment Arrangement tab will also be enabled to create a new payment arrangement. Note Not all the users will have permission to cancel the payment arrangement plan. Only users with the security role to cancel will have this permission . Also, customers with one open payment arrangement will have a cancel button. No cooling period is required to create a payment arrangement after cancelling the existing. it can happen directly after. CD 89 If PTP is broken, customer treatment steps will resume CD193. REQ_4062 Solution shall allow for one active payment arrangement (Promise to pay) at a time. When a payment arrangement is cancelled, the unpaid amount is added to the total amount and can be included directly (no cooling period) in a new P2P plan. Collection Suspension Collection treatment process can be suspended (temporarily or permanently ) in certain situations. For instance, if the customer is hospitalized. With proper privileges, an agent can suspend collection treatment process for a limited or unlimited time. The agent must select a valid reason for the collection treatment suspension. Upon expiration of the set duration, the customer will be moved back to the collection treatment process. Temporary treatment suspension – deferred to L5 phase 3 Permanent treatment suspension – descoped Manual treatment progression (skip steps) - descoped 19 Customer enquiries about a possible change in treatment steps. (suspend) Temporary TREATMENT SUSPENSION IS DEFERRED TO L5 PHASE 3 Agent from the Collections tab navigates to Edit icon on the Collection Suspension widget. Treatment temporary suspension (Aligned with Mobily - 4 March 2025): Customer is in treatment. Agent will submit a request from the collections screen to suspend treatment for a configured number of days. Treatment will be paused immediately for the chosen period and the service will be unsuspended if it was previously suspended due to treatment. Treatment will not progress even if a later invoice was generated during treatment suspension period. When the treatment suspension period ends, treatment resumes, and service might be accordingly suspended. Customer will be in the treatment step that is applicable based on the configured treatment cycle from the day he originally entered treatment. E.g.:  25 Jan customer is in OG bar, on 30 Jan he should enter full bar. On 27 Jan, he receives temporary suspension for 5 days. So, on 1 Feb, he returns to FULL BAR not to OG bar. If there is any active suspension (promise to pay (phase 3), collections grace, temporary suspension), customer is not allowed to take a new one. There shall be security access control to allow only privileged profiles to enable/disable temporary treatment suspension and this shall be different from the access control of collections grace period. (Currently cc product gives same control for suspension and grace). Temporary treatment suspension can be done in any treatment step before service is deactivated, including DCA step: So, assume a customer is in DCA treatment step and his service status is DCA, and was included in external DCA file or an internal DCA handling action was created for him (if he is not eligible for external DCA handling). Then, an agent with privilege can suspend treatment for this customer for a limited time. As a result, the customer’s treatment is suspended at DCA step, and his service status will be active. He will not be removed from the previously generated external DCA file, but he will not be included in the next external DCA file if it is generated while treatment suspension period didn’t yet end. Also, any internal DCA handling action that was created before the treatment suspension will not be automatically closed; an agent needs to process it manually. CC will reflect the Temporary Treatment Suspension Status and history. CSR can delete an active temporary treatment suspension before its end date. This will return the customer immediately to the applicable treatment step counting from the date he initially entered treatment. NOTE Not all the agents will have permission to edit the collection steps. Only agents with the security role to edit the steps will have this permission .

If the customer fails to make the payment on the payment due date: \u2022 An SMS (if configured) will be triggered to the customer\u2019s contact number as and when a customer enters the collection treatment or moves from one collection step to another or exits the collection treatment. \u2022 An email (if configured) will be sent to the customer\u2019s email address as and when a customer enters the collection treatment or moves from one collection step to another or exits the collection treatment. \u2022 A letter will be sent to the customer\u2019s postal address requesting overdue payment. \u2022 Penalty fees will be charged if there is no response from the customer. \u2022 The customer\u2019s account will be suspended . \u2022 A write-off happens, and the query is closed note: Customer shall also be able to make early or advance payments of unbilled amount if he/she doesn't have any pending bills. This is supported in another view on CC. (no use case in L4.2 for this) note: Bulk actions on a list of customers (e.g. suspend multiple customers) is requested and is to be discussed during design how and where to implement it. this might.\u00a0 this might be subject to CCB.

COLL002 Solution shall require Customer Connect to display the correct Bar status for customers who are in collections. COLL007 Solution shall allow collection agents to view the bills, payments, credit control history, and the follow up history under the customer information. Subject to CCB Output of CCB - All fields are available but in different screens , cannot present in single screen (Requirement to present in single collection tab is dropped by Mobily) 5 Customer in treatment Collection summary, status, and the amount due are displayed. REQ_2199 The solution shall allow the customer's financial account to be traversed through various treatment steps once he enters the treatment process. 6 Customer is exempt from treatment. For customers with an exemption, an Exempted status will be displayed. Exemption from treatment rules as confirmed with Mobily (4 March 2025): The use case to Add or remove customer to/from whitelist in CC is not in the planned scope for L5. However, we can exempt customers from collections using the \u201cExempt from Treatment\u201d flag. As part of this use case, Whitelist flag will not be used in the logic for any treatment exemption. Exempt from Treatment flag will be instead used as explained below and customer will not enter treatment at all if this flag is enabled. Exempt from treatment flag can be updated from CC or via patch customer API. If it is enabled, it will exempt the customer from entering collections until it is disabled. If it is disabled, the customer may enter collections, and treatment steps will start from the date of unchecking the flag not from the oldest invoice generation date. If the customer was in the treatment (any step, even DCA) and this flag is enabled later for him, he will be out of treatment, and this will result in unsuspending the service if it was suspended due to treatment. Only if this flag is enabled, customer will show as exempted from treatment in collections tab. For other reasons like Royal customer segment or below Treatment entry threshold, customers will not enter treatment but will not be marked as exempted from treatment in collections tab. There shall be specific security access control to allow only privileged profiles to enable/disable \"exempt from treatment\" flag. (Currently, this flag can be updated by anyone who has edit access to billing settings tab. it shall have separate access control ) If customer is in Collections Grace Period, and the exempt from treatment flag is enabled while in collections grace, then collections grace will be automatically cancelled, and the customer will be able to use all his available credit limit. AREQ_2188 \"The solution shall ensure certain customers can be exempted from the treatment process.

But Collection activity will be on hold till payment arrangement is active. Note: If customer didn't pay the installment amount on time, payment arrangement is immediately broken, and the remaining installment amount should be added to the next bill. Aligned with Mobily IT: When a promise to pay is broken, customer goes back to the treatment step that he was in before the payment arrangement, and then progresses from there in the treatment steps as per the treatment plan. There are no notifications or reminders before each payment due date in the P2P plan.

Collection Suspension Collection treatment process can be suspended (temporarily or permanently ) in certain situations. For instance, if the customer is hospitalized. With proper privileges, an agent can suspend collection treatment process for a limited or unlimited time. The agent must select a valid reason for the collection treatment suspension. Upon expiration of the set duration, the customer will be moved back to the collection treatment process. Temporary treatment suspension \u2013 deferred to L5 phase 3 Permanent treatment suspension \u2013 descoped Manual treatment progression (skip steps) - descoped 19 Customer enquiries about a possible change in treatment steps. (suspend) Temporary TREATMENT SUSPENSION IS DEFERRED TO L5 PHASE 3 Agent from the Collections tab navigates to\u00a0Edit icon on the Collection Suspension widget. Treatment temporary suspension (Aligned with Mobily - 4 March 2025): Customer is in treatment. Agent will submit a request from the collections screen to suspend treatment for a configured number of days. Treatment will be paused immediately for the chosen period and the service will be unsuspended if it was previously suspended due to treatment. Treatment will not progress even if a later invoice was generated during treatment suspension period. When the treatment suspension period ends, treatment resumes, and service might be accordingly suspended. Customer will be in the treatment step that is applicable based on the configured treatment cycle from the day he originally entered treatment. E.g.: \u00a025 Jan customer is in OG bar, on 30 Jan he should enter full bar. On 27 Jan, he receives temporary suspension for 5 days. So, on 1 Feb, he returns to FULL BAR not to OG bar. If there is any active suspension (promise to pay (phase 3), collections grace, temporary suspension), customer is not allowed to take a new one. There shall be security access control to allow only privileged profiles to enable/disable temporary treatment suspension and this shall be different from the access control of collections grace period. (Currently cc product gives same control for suspension and grace). Temporary treatment suspension can be done in any treatment step before service is deactivated, including DCA step: So, assume a customer is in DCA treatment step and his service status is DCA, and was included in external DCA file or an internal DCA handling action was created for him (if he is not eligible for external DCA handling). Then, an agent with privilege can suspend treatment for this customer for a limited time. As a result, the customer\u2019s treatment is suspended at DCA step, and his service status will be active. He will not be removed from the previously generated external DCA file, but he will not be included in the next external DCA file if it is generated while treatment suspension period didn\u2019t yet end. Also, any internal DCA handling action that was created before the treatment suspension will not be automatically closed; an agent needs to process it manually. CC will reflect the Temporary Treatment Suspension Status and history. CSR can delete an active temporary treatment suspension before its end date. This will return the customer immediately to the applicable treatment step counting from the date he initially entered treatment. NOTE Not all the agents will have permission to edit the collection steps. Only agents with the security role to edit the steps will have this permission . (editing treatment steps is descoped - step 20) Also, if Payment Arrangement is already created (phase 3) or Collection suspension is created for some reason then the Edit button will be disabled. On hover over button, it will show reason it is disabled. customer is notified on treatment step suspension and resumption. REQ_2194 The solution shall enable treatment steps to be stalled depending on CSR workforce capacity (Call Center) REQ_4066 Solution shall allow an agent with proper privilege to suspend treatment process for a limited or unlimited time and to select a suspension reason. This is only possible if there is no active payment arrangement. Upon expiration of the set duration, treatment steps resume. (payment arrangement part is deferred to L5 phase 3) SV1048_013 \"Verify that provisioning commands are correctly triggered for: Treatment suspension and unsuspension\" REQ_2189 The solution shall support a Call Center CSR keeping customers out of treatment based on customer request - manual process based on customer validation, risk, score payment history 20 Agent moves treatment step.
